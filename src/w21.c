/*
Permutations.

Write a program that takes a single integer as input (n) and returns all 
permutations of the characters from 1 to n each on its own line. 

For example:
./permutations 3
123
132
213
231
312
321

The order of your output is up to to you, but you must print all n! permutations
without repeting any.
